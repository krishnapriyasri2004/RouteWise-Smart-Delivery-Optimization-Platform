## 🚀 Usage Guide

### 📍 Route Management

* Go to the **Routes** section
* Click "Create New Route"
* Enter route and delivery points
* Choose algorithm
* Generate and assign to vehicle

### 📦 Cargo Management

* Go to **Cargo** section
* Add item details (weight, priority)
* Click "Optimize Cargo" (Knapsack algorithm)
* Review and assign

### 📌 Coimbatore-Specific Features

* Select **Coimbatore** in region dropdown
* Access preloaded areas and landmarks
* Use **Tamil support** and traffic integration

---

## 🧮 Algorithms Used

### 🎒 Knapsack Algorithm

* Maximizes priority cargo within space
* Ideal for load balancing and space efficiency

### ⚡ Greedy Algorithm

* Fast and real-time
* Picks the next nearest unvisited point

### 📊 Dynamic Programming

* Computes globally optimal routes
* Best when fewer but high-value deliveries exist
